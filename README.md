# Giphy-Apeyi
School project 2
Steven Miller

This project was to make a wepage with a jquery enabled search bar that would send an ajax request to the giphy repository and bring back whatever the user of the site had query'd

you can search for any gif in the search bar and use the results drop down to increase or decrease the number of results that you recieve on the page.

I used jquery, a little java, and i used tailwind css which I found to be much more difficult than bootstrap and honestly very frustrating due to having no intellisense on my visual studio code. 

for improvements i would like to redo the webpage with bootstrap and add more features to it. like a more diverse selection of gifs on screen. A more impressive nav bar, and a feature where it will display randomly chosen gifs on the page when the user first visits the page.
